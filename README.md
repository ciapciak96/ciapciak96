iOS Developer
-------------

I'm a self-taught iOS developer, who switched careers from professional translation to tech. Started with Swift, I am looking forward to continuously widening my horizons and keep learning new stuff. I am into making my own (mostly UIKit) apps that at one point I found needed in my daily life 🌸 ! Privately retro tech enthusiast and collector 🖥

*   🌍  I am based in Poland
*   🧠  In the meantime I am learning Python, but my main focus is development in Swift (and currently expanding my SwiftUI skills)
*   🤝  I am open to collaborating on anything Swift related
*   ⚡  Hobbies include: computer and overall tech history, games, linguistics and literature
